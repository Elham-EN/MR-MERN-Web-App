/**
 * Used aggregate to provide a sequence of data aggregation operations. In my case
 * the first operation $match, where we look for the movies document that matches
 * a specified id.
 *
 * Next used $lookup to perform an equality join using the _id field from the movie
 * document with the movie_id field from reviews collection.
 *
 * The $lookup stage has the following syntax:
 * {
 *   $lookup: {
 *              from: <collection to join>,
 *              localField: <field from the input document>,
 *              foreignField: <field from the documents of the "from" collection>,
 *              as: <output array field>
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * This finds all the reviews with the specific movie id and returns the specific
 * movie together with the reviews in an array.
